It (i.e., 54 sub graphs for Fig 8.opj)  is an Origin project file. Please use Origin (https://www.originlab.com/) to open the file. 

Please select menu Window -> other widows(M)... to open the corresponding sub graph (please use Name and Type to guide your selection).

We use an example to show the naming style for each sub graph. 

For project camel, there are the following files:
1. "camel-camel-data-lr" is a workbook storing all the obtained data for camel.
2. "camelfig-camel-fig-lr-stable" is the sub graph we used in Fig. 8, which contain all the evolution curves when E(c)=20%, 30% and 40%. 
3. "Ec20-camel-camel-fig-lr-stable" (E(c)=20%), "Ec30-camel-camel-fig-lr-stable" (E(c)=30%), and "Ec40-camel-camel-fig-lr-stable" (E(c)=40%) show the three sub graphs for "camelfig-camel-fig-lr-stable" when E(c)=20%, 30%, and 40%, respectively.
