# ITC_TSE2021
This is the replication package for our work submitted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.

Note that we only provide some sample CDNs and ICDNs. The whole data set and tools will be available after our paper's acceptance.

# CDN-Qu et al. and ICDN-pan et al.
This directory contains the CDNs and ICDNs that we built for all the subject systems used in our experiments. CDN is the network used in Qu et al.'s work while ICDN is our improved version of CDNs. Note that the whole data set will be available after our work's acceptance. Of course, interested readers can email us (Email: wfpan@zjgsu.edu.cn) to get the whole data set in advance. Please use your institutional email address.
